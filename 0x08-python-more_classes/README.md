# Project 0x06.

Python - Classes and Objects


## Read or watch:


    Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod and staticmethod yet). https://swaroop-c-h.gitbook.io/byte-of-python/
    Object-Oriented Programming (Please *be careful*: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You DON’T have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The __init__ Method, “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “Public, Protected, and Private Attributes”). https://www.python-course.eu/python3_object_oriented_programming.php

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google.
   
### General


    Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
    What is OOP
    “first-class everything”
    What is a class
    What is an object and an instance
    What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
    What is an attribute
    What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
    What is self
    What is a method
    What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
    What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
    What is a property
    What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
    What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
    How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
    How to bind attributes to object and classes
    What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class
    How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
    How to use the getattr function


## Requirements

### General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc
    All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')


### More Info

    Documentation is now mandatory! Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments. Example Google Style Python Docstrings. https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html

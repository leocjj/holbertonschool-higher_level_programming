# Project 0x09.

Python - Everything is object


## Read or watch:

    9.10. Objects and values
    9.11. Aliasing
    Immutable vs mutable types
    Mutation (Only this chapter)
    9.12. Cloning lists
    Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing


## Learning Objectives


At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google.


### General


    Why Python programming is awesome (dont forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
    What is an object
    What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
    What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
    What is a reference
    What is an assignment
    What is an alias
    How to know if two variables are identical
    How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
    How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
    What is mutable and immutable
    What are the built-in mutable types
    What are the built-in immutable types
    How does Python pass variables to functions

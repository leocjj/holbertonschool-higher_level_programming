## Learning Objectives


At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google.


### General


    Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
    What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
    What is a subclass
    How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
    When can an instance have new attributes
    How to inherit class from another
    How to define a class with multiple base classes
    What is the default class every class inherit from
    How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
    Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
    What is the purpose of inheritance
    What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions


## Requirements

### Python scripts


    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc


### Python Test Cases

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files should end with a new line
    All your test files should be inside a folder tests
    All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
    All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
    All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
    We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
